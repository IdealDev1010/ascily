Some users experience light, temporary bruising that indicates improved circulation. We recommend applying a light massage oil before use and attaching the included filters to the massager for optimal performance. Start with the lowest intensity and move the device continuously to minimize discomfort. Always listen to your body and adjust accordingly.</p>"

Hold the device in place until the skin is fully drawn in. Press the release button to free the skin. For best results, we recommend a 20-minute session per targeted area, repeating the process as necessary.</p>"
